AppTrack is a web application designed to help candidates track job applications. It allows users to manage the stages of their job search by organizing applications into a structured workflow. The app provides users with an easy-to-use Kanban board, where they can track their progress through various job application stages.

## Features

- **Job Tracking:** Organize job applications into predefined stages: Open, Applied, Shortlisted, Interview, Offer, Rejected, Closed.
- **Kanban Board:** Visualize job applications in different stages using a drag-and-drop interface.
- **User Accounts:** Each user has their own job tracking board and can manage multiple job applications.
- **User Reports:** Each user can download a .csv file of all the jobs reports from within a given start and end date. This is great if you are claiming JSA or something similar, whereby you must show proof of jobs you have been working towards.
